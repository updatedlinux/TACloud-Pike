ALERT !!

Installing Manila and/or Designate on both Centos 7 and Ubuntu 16.04lts breaks
the horizon Dashboard. After installing those components, logging to the web 
dashboard is impossible.

The current workaround for both operating systems is disable offline compression
in the horizon dashboard.

On Centos, edit the following file:

vi /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/settings.py

And set COMPRESS_OFFLINE to False:

COMPRESS_OFFLINE = False

On Ubuntu 16.04lts, the procedure is almost the same. Edit the following file:

vi /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.py

And set COMPRESS_OFFLINE to False:

COMPRESS_OFFLINE = False

On both systems, as a "failsafe", manually compress the horizon files by using
the following commands:

On Centos 7:

cd /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/
python manage.py compress --force
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

systemctl restart httpd


On Ubuntu 16.04lts:

cd /usr/share/openstack-dashboard/
python manage.py compress --force
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

systemctl restart apache2

END.-
