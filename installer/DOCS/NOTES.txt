IMPORTANT NOTES !!

Be sure to have good knowledge of the following topics:

- Administration of Linux.
- Virtualization on Linux with kvm / qemu / libvirt.
- LinuxBridge and OpenVSwitch.
- Linux namespaces.
- Networks in general.
- OpenStack.
- NFS, GlusterFS.
- "Correct" Install of Centos 7 O/S.

This installer is ONLY for Centos 7 64-bit (x86_64 / amd64). Do not
attempt to use it in another environment.


1.- Base repositories and correct installation of Centos 7:

Install your centos 7 server with 64 bits and select the packages for a basic infraestructure server without
graphics environment. Do not include any extra repo like EPEL, ELREPO or RPMFORGE "yet", but you'll need to
include EPEL along the Newton RDO Repo.

If you are going to use a "Cinder Volume", remember to reserve the disk space for it.

Install RDO OpenStack PIKE Repos for Centos:

yum install centos-release-openstack-pike

Install EPEL:

yum -y install epel-release

After installing centos-release-openstack-pike and EPEL Repos, do a full update and reboot if necessary (new kernel installed):

yum -y upgrade
reboot

2.- System Control (/etc/sysctl.conf).

WARNING: This is VERY important!. Make sure you have the following items configured in 
/etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0

If you do not have configured this, please do it now and then reboot the machine.


3. OpenVSWITCH:

First install openvswitch. Run the commands below (after placing the repositories listed above):

yum -y install openvswitch

service openvswitch start

chkconfig openvswitch on

Then, create the bridges:

First step: br-int (OpenStack integration switch/bridge):

ovs-vsctl add-br br-int

Next step: br-enp0s9 (OpenStack networks switch/bridge). Example for "enp0s9" interface:

ovs-vsctl add-br br-enp0s9
ovs-vsctl add-port br-enp0s9 enp0s9

Please remember that in Centos the interfaces are using the new names. ethX is no longer used,
unless you are running a virtual machine with virtio (network).


NOTE: Always try to use an interface that is FREE and can be "dedicated" to OpenStack. 
For other configurations, see the information that is available online. It is not necessary 
to place the interfaces associated with the switches in /etc/network/interfaces, unless you 
have "shared" and not dedicated to OpenStack, or unless you are using special "vlan-based"
configurations.

For more information, please refer to OpenStack main documentation site:

http://docs.openstack.org

4.- OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: El-repo.org kernel-ml (Series 4.x) for CENTOS 7.

You'll benefit a lot of by using the very advanced kernels from "el-repo.org". Also, if you plan to use CEPH, this is mandatory!.

The following instructions will help you to automate "el-repo.org" kernel-ml installation:

yum -y install yum-utils
rpm --import https://www.elrepo.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-elrepo.org
rpm -Uvh http://www.elrepo.org/elrepo-release-7.0-2.el7.elrepo.noarch.rpm
yum-config-manager --enable elrepo-kernel
yum clean all
yum -y update
yum install kernel-ml kernel-ml-devel kernel-ml-doc -y
sed -r -i 's/saved/0/g' /etc/default/grub
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
sync
reboot

After the reboot, your server will boot with the kernel series 4.x from "el-repo.org".
